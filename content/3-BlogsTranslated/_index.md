### [Blog 1 - How Novo Nordisk, Columbia University and AWS collaborated with the OpenFold AI Consortium to develop OpenFold3](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog post shares how Novo Nordisk, Columbia University, and AWS collaborated to develop OpenFold3, an advanced protein structure prediction model, using scalable and cost-effective bioinformatics solutions on AWS. The post explores how the team leveraged AWS services and innovative approaches to overcome challenges in training this complex model, including creating a lightweight research environment with Research Collaboration Platform (RCP), optimizing Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) generation using AWS Graviton processors, and implementing distributed AI/ML training infrastructure.

### [Blog 2 - Accelerate Amazon Redshift Data Lake queries with AWS Glue Data Catalog Column Statistics](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog post highlights performance improvements in Amazon Redshift data lake query processing using AWS Glue Data Catalog column statistics. The post demonstrates how using column statistics, bloom filters on partition columns, new query rewrite rules, and faster metadata retrieval can improve query performance significantly. Using industry-standard TPC-DS benchmarks, the total execution time improved by 3x, with some queries achieving speeds up to 12x faster.

### [Blog 3 - Modernizing real-time payment orchestration on AWS](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog post discusses a real-time payment orchestration framework that uses event-driven architecture and AWS serverless services to enhance the resiliency, efficiency, and scalability of real-time payments. The solution addresses challenges faced by traditional payment systems, including high latency, availability issues, and scalability constraints. It demonstrates how decomposing payment processing into distinct business capabilities, implementing tenant-based segregation, and using Amazon MSK for asynchronous communication can improve overall payment processing performance.

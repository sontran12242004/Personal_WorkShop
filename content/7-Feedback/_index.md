## Internship Evaluation - From an FCJer's Perspective

### Overall Evaluation

#### 1. Working Environment

Throughout my internship at FCJ, I clearly felt that this is a friendly, open, and professional working environment. From the very first day, I was warmly welcomed and introduced to the team, which immediately made me feel comfortable and integrated. Team members are always ready to help whenever I encounter difficulties, whether during or outside working hours. I remember many times when I had questions late in the evening, and the trainers still took time to answer and guide me patiently.

The workspace is comfortable and tidy, with modern equipment and a well-organized layout that helps me easily focus and maintain productivity. The office atmosphere is always positive, with everyone maintaining a professional yet relaxed attitude. The open communication culture allows me to freely express my opinions and ask questions without hesitation.

However, I believe that if the company could add more team building activities or internal social gatherings, such as monthly team lunches, coffee breaks, or quarterly team outings, the bonding spirit among members would be even better. These activities would not only strengthen relationships but also create more opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration across different teams.

#### 2. Support from Mentor & Trainer

As an intern with limited experience, I was fortunate to learn from many dedicated trainers such as Anh Kha, Anh Thịnh, Sư phụ Hưng, Anh Hoàng, Anh Vĩ, Anh Thiện, Chị Linh Nhi, along with the Little Member FCJ members. Each trainer brought their unique expertise and teaching style, which enriched my learning experience in different ways.

Anh Kha always provided clear, structured guidance and was patient in explaining complex concepts. Anh Thịnh shared many practical insights from real-world projects. Sư phụ Hưng's deep technical knowledge and systematic approach helped me understand the fundamentals thoroughly. Anh Hoàng's enthusiasm and encouragement motivated me to push beyond my comfort zone. Anh Vĩ's attention to detail and best practices taught me the importance of quality work. Anh Thiện's problem-solving approach showed me different ways to tackle challenges. Chị Linh Nhi's organizational skills and support helped me manage my tasks effectively. The Little Member FCJ members, despite being peers, were always willing to share their experiences and help me navigate through difficulties.

Everyone not only provided detailed guidance for each task but also thoroughly explained foundational knowledge, helping me understand deeply rather than just following mechanically. I especially appreciate that the trainers always created conditions for me to find solutions to problems myself before providing answers – this helped me grow significantly in thinking and skills. For instance, when I encountered a technical issue, instead of immediately giving me the solution, they would guide me with questions like "What have you tried?" or "What do you think might be the cause?" This approach developed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

#### 3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major

The tasks assigned to me align well with my academic major in Information Technology, while also opening up many new areas of knowledge that I had never encountered before. The work covered various aspects including cloud computing, DevOps practices, AI-driven development, IAM security, and system architecture – all of which are highly relevant to modern software development.

For example, working on AWS services helped me apply theoretical knowledge about distributed systems and cloud architecture that I learned in university. The DevOps tasks allowed me to practice automation and CI/CD concepts that were only briefly mentioned in coursework. The AI-related projects introduced me to practical applications of machine learning and generative AI, which are cutting-edge technologies in the industry.

Thanks to this, I was able to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and learn practical skills for future work. The combination of theoretical understanding from university and hands-on experience from the internship created a comprehensive learning experience that prepared me well for my future career.

#### 4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities

The internship helped me develop many important skills that are essential for professional growth:

**Technical Skills:**
- Using project management tools like Jira, Trello, or similar platforms to track tasks and collaborate with team members
- Working with AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, and various other cloud services
- Understanding DevOps practices including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and automation
- Learning about AI tools and their integration into development workflows
- Gaining experience with version control systems and collaborative coding practices

**Soft Skills:**
- Teamwork skills: Learning to collaborate effectively with team members, understanding different working styles, and contributing to group projects
- Professional communication skills: Writing clear technical documentation, presenting ideas in meetings, and communicating effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Time management: Balancing multiple tasks, prioritizing work, and meeting deadlines
- Real-world problem-solving thinking: Approaching complex problems systematically, breaking them down into manageable parts, and finding creative solutions

**Professional Development:**
- Understanding industry best practices and standards
- Learning about career paths in cloud computing and software development
- Gaining insights into how large-scale projects are managed
- Developing a professional mindset and work ethic

In addition, the sharing from mentors and trainers about work experience and career orientation also helped me greatly in determining my own development path. They shared stories about their career journeys, challenges they faced, and how they overcame them. These insights were invaluable in helping me understand what to expect in my future career and how to prepare for it.

#### 5. Company Culture & Team Spirit

FCJ culture emphasizes respect, support, and responsibility. From day one, I noticed that everyone treats each other with respect, regardless of position or experience level. Senior members are approachable and willing to share knowledge, while everyone supports each other in achieving common goals.

Although work intensity can sometimes be high, especially during project deadlines or important events, everyone always coordinates smoothly, supports each other, and maintains a cheerful atmosphere during work. I observed that when someone faces a challenge, others immediately step in to help. This collaborative spirit creates a positive work environment where everyone can thrive.

The team spirit is particularly evident during team meetings and collaborative sessions. Everyone's opinions are valued, and there's a genuine sense of collective ownership of projects. Even as an intern, my contributions were acknowledged and appreciated, which made me feel valued and motivated to do my best.

This made me – even as an intern – always feel like I am part of the team. I never felt like an outsider or someone who was just there temporarily. The inclusive culture and supportive environment made my internship experience truly meaningful and enjoyable.

#### 6. Internship Policies & Benefits

FCJ provides a fair internship allowance that recognizes the value of interns' contributions. Additionally, the company offers flexible time arrangements when I need adjustments, which is extremely helpful for balancing between study and work. This flexibility allowed me to attend important classes, complete assignments, and still fulfill my internship responsibilities effectively.

The opportunity to participate in internal training sessions is also a great value that I highly appreciate. These sessions covered various topics from technical skills to soft skills, and they were conducted by experienced professionals. The training not only enhanced my knowledge but also provided networking opportunities with other interns and team members.

Other benefits that made the internship experience positive include:
- Access to learning resources and documentation
- Opportunities to attend external events and workshops
- Support for professional development activities
- Recognition and feedback on work performance
- A supportive environment that encourages learning and growth

These policies and benefits demonstrate that FCJ values its interns and is committed to providing a meaningful learning experience rather than just using interns for basic tasks.

### Additional Questions

#### 1. What did you find most satisfying during your internship?

What satisfied me most was the opportunity to learn directly from experienced trainers and the enthusiastic support from the entire team. However, there were several specific aspects that made this experience particularly satisfying:

**Learning from Experts:** Being able to work alongside and learn from professionals who have years of experience in the industry was incredibly valuable. Each trainer brought unique perspectives and knowledge that I couldn't have gained from textbooks or online courses alone.

**Real-World Application:** The satisfaction of applying what I learned to actual projects and seeing tangible results was immensely rewarding. Whether it was deploying a cloud infrastructure, implementing security best practices, or contributing to a team project, each accomplishment gave me a sense of achievement.

**Personal Growth:** Watching myself grow from someone who was hesitant and unsure to someone who could confidently tackle challenges and contribute meaningfully to projects was deeply satisfying. The transformation in my skills, confidence, and professional mindset was remarkable.

**Supportive Environment:** The fact that I could make mistakes, ask questions, and learn without fear of judgment created an environment where I could truly grow. The team's patience and encouragement made every learning moment enjoyable rather than stressful.

**Meaningful Work:** Knowing that my contributions, even as an intern, were valued and made a difference to the team and projects was highly satisfying. I never felt like I was doing busy work; every task had purpose and meaning.

#### 2. What do you think the company should improve?

While my overall experience was excellent, there are a few areas where the company could make improvements to enhance the internship program even further:

**More Group Activities:** The company could enhance more group activities and cross-departmental experience-sharing workshops to help interns gain broader perspectives. Regular team building activities, social events, or informal gatherings would strengthen relationships and create a more cohesive team environment.

**Structured Mentorship Program:** While the support was excellent, having a more structured mentorship program with regular one-on-one sessions, goal setting, and progress reviews could provide even more focused guidance for interns' development.

**Advanced Training Opportunities:** Offering more advanced training courses on professional skills, specialized technical topics, or industry certifications would help interns develop deeper expertise in areas of interest.

**Cross-Functional Exposure:** Providing opportunities for interns to work with different teams or departments would give them a broader understanding of how the organization works and help them discover their interests and strengths.

**Feedback Mechanisms:** While feedback was provided, having more formal and structured feedback sessions with documented development plans could help interns track their progress and identify areas for improvement more systematically.

**Resource Library:** Creating a centralized resource library with documentation, best practices, tutorials, and learning materials would be valuable for interns to reference and continue learning independently.

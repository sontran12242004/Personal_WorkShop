### 📌 Personal Notes:
Week 7 is a pivotal week to start moving to heavier content like deep networking, IAM, autoscaling… Hands-on CLI operations helped me understand the nature of services better compared to just using Console. This is also the first time managing a real EC2 server, so I gained a lot of practical experience.

### Overview
* A Production system cannot be considered complete without Monitoring and Alerting capabilities. You cannot sit watching the screen 24/7 to check if the Server is still alive

* In this module, we will set up monitoring and alerting for MiniMarket using AWS operations management services:

* Amazon CloudWatch: Collect metrics (Metrics) from EC2, RDS, ELB
* Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Notification service. We will use it to send Emails to administrators when the system encounters issues
* We will set up a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor Web Server CPU. If CPU exceeds 70% (sign of overload or attack), the system will automatically trigger SNS to send emergency alert Email

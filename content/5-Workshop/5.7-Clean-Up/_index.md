### Overview

* Congratulations on successfully developing HRM on AWS!

* However, our work does not stop there. The final and most important step to protect your "wallet" is Resource Cleanup.

* The services we develop such as NAT Gateway, Elastic Load Balancer, RDS, ElastiCache are all charged by the hour, regardless of whether you use them or not. If you forget to delete them, the bill at the end of the month can be very high.

* We will perform the system dismantling process in the correct order to ensure that we do not miss any causes of hidden costs.
